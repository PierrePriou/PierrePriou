- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pierre Priou, a research scientist at Akvaplan-niva in TromsÃ¸, Norway.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in marine ecology with a focus on pelagic ecosystems. I use active acoustics to better document and understand the distribution and behaviour of fish and zooplankton using autonomous sampling platforms (gliders, surface vehicles, and moorings).
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working with R, Python, and Julia.
